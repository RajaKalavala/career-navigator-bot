    "## Part 1: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Many students and early-career professionals often feel overwhelmed or uncertain when choosing a suitable career path. With a vast number of job roles, skill requirements, and learning resources available, it becomes challenging to identify what aligns best with their interests, educational background, and existing skills. Generic career advice and search engines lack the personalization and adaptability required to support users in making informed career decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The Career Navigator Bot is a sophisticated and intelligent conversational AI chatbot designed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the user’s interests, strengths, and educational background.\n",
    "- Recommend suitable career paths based on user inputs.\n",
    "- Generate structured, step-by-step learning paths to pursue the selected careers.\n",
    "- Suggest relevant job roles, internship opportunities, and essential tools or skills.\n",
    "- Track user progress and tailor future recommendations accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates the principles of modern conversational AI architecture using OpenAI’s function calling, with emphasis on system design, managed conversation flow, consistent output formatting, and the implementation of safety layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Level Development Stages\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of the chatbot is structured into the following stages, following the approach demonstrated in the ShopAssist AI project:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stage 1: Intent Understanding\n",
    "- Intent Clarity Layer\n",
    "- Intent Confirmation Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stage 2: Career Mapping and Information Extraction\n",
    "- Career Mapping Layer\n",
    "- User Information Extraction Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stage 3: Recommendation and Guidance\n",
    "- Career Recommendation Layer\n",
    "- Learning Path and Job Suggestion Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Each stage is implemented using OpenAI's GPT model with function calling, enhanced through few-shot prompting, and designed for clarity, modularity, and user-focused interaction.\n"

    "## Part 2: Environment Setup and Dataset Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "This section sets up the necessary environment to build and run the Career Navigator Bot. It includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Installing required libraries\n",
    "- Importing essential Python modules\n",
    "- Loading the career dataset that will be used for mapping user intent to real-world career paths\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes various career options along with their associated skills, learning paths, common job roles, and recommended tools. This will serve as a knowledge base for the chatbot to generate meaningful recommendations.\n"

    "\n",
    "The Career Navigator Bot is built as a multi-stage conversational AI system using OpenAI’s GPT model and function calling capabilities. The system is designed to interact intelligently with users, understand their career-related needs, and provide structured guidance using a mock dataset of diverse career paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture is modular, with each stage responsible for a specific part of the conversation flow. This layered approach ensures a clear separation of concerns and enables better control, accuracy, and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project is a mock dataset created to simulate a structured knowledge base for career guidance. It contains 20 unique career paths, each with fields including `career_name`, `required_skills`, `learning_path`, `common_job_titles`, and `recommended_tools`. This structured information allows the chatbot to match user inputs with relevant career options, generate personalized learning paths, and suggest job roles and tools commonly used in the industry. By referencing this dataset during function calls, the chatbot ensures consistency in responses and avoids hallucination, leading to more reliable and tailored career guidance.\n",

    "The chatbot system is divided into the following functional components:\n",
